# Intro
As far as I'm aware, there's no app that lets you easily play from sheet music on a phone.
Most sheet music apps are geared towards having a tablet, but I'm not going to bring my tablet around
all the time, whereas I'll always have my phone on me when I happen upon a piano, and of course, not everyone
has a tablet. 

Idea: I made an app called Autoscroll Sidekick for Android. It's an extremely bare bones app that scrolls
a long image at a set speed in pixels/second. If I make a Python tool that lets you cut up a sheet music PDF
into one really long image, and then tell you how fast to automatically scroll the image, then you could perform a piece
using your phone without having your face next to your screen trying to read sheet music on a 6 inch display.
